## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/manasdalakoti/univai-hack-data 

## Installation
### First, you will need to install git, if you don't have it already.

### Next, clone this repository by opening a terminal and typing the following commands:

### • $ cd $HOME  # or any other development directory you prefer
### • $ git clone https://github.com/Karssido/GDSC-128-APPLICATION-TASK
### • $ cd Task-1 (Data Visualization and Classification).ipynb

## Python & Required Libraries
### Of course, you obviously need Python. Python 2 is already preinstalled on most systems nowadays, and sometimes even Python 3. You can check which version(s) you have by typing the following commands:

### • $ python --version   # for Python 2
### • $ python3 --version  # for Python 3

### Any Python 3 version should be fine, preferably ≥3.5. If you don't have Python 3, I recommend installing it (Python ≥2.6 should work, but it is deprecated so Python 3 is preferable). 

## Starting Jupyter
### In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory GDSC-128-APPLICATION-TASK/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

#### • ipython notebook Task-1 (Data Visualization and Classification).ipynb
#### or

#### • jupyter notebook Task-1 (Data Visualization and Classification).ipynb
#### or open with Jupyter Lab

#### • jupyter lab
#### This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
